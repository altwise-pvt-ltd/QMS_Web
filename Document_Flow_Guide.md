# Document Management: How It Works

This guide explains how to manage documents in the QMS, focusing on making the process simple, safe, and professional.

## 1. The Safety Check (The Preview Window)

Before you finalize an upload, you will see a **"Preview"** button.

**What is it for?**
Think of this as a "look-before-you-leap" feature. It opens a window showing you the exact file you selected before it is saved to the official system.

**Why use it?**

- **Avoid Mistakes**: Make sure you haven't accidentally picked an old draft or the wrong file.
- **Check Clarity**: Ensure the document is readable and isn't missing any pages.
- **Peace of Mind**: Once a document is "Official," it creates a permanent record. This step ensures that record is perfect.

## 2. The Official Master View (The Review Page)

Once a document is uploaded, it moves to the **Review Page**. This is the official home for that document.

**What is it for?**
This page is designed for daily work. It removes all technical distractions so you can focus entirely on the document content.

**Key Features:**

- **On-Screen Actions**: Big, clear buttons for **Printing** and **Downloading** are placed right above the document. No more searching through menus.
- **High Visibility**: We use high-contrast colors and clear fonts so the document is easy on the eyes, even if you are reviewing it for a long period.
- **Easy Navigation**: You can jump back to your library or switch between different versions with a single click.

## 3. The Simple 3-Step Flow

1. **Initiate**: Go to your Document Library and click the section where you want to add or update a file.
2. **Validate**: Use the **Preview Window** to double-check your file.
3. **Access**: Once saved, use the **Master View** to read, print, or share the official version of the document.
